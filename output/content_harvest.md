PHNOM PENH— As Thailand’s new government takes power on the back of a nationalist, war-ready campaign, analysts say Cambodia can no longer afford to sit back. Instead, they urge Phnom Penh to double down on self-reliance at home while aggressively internationalizing its diplomacy abroad, warning that the fragile border ceasefire and Thailand’s shifting military posture could quickly unravel.

Since the second round of fighting ended in a December ceasefire, Cambodians have closely followed Thailand’s general election on February 8, hoping a new government would restore cooperation and ease tensions along the border. Those hopes dimmed when caretaker Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul secured a decisive victory. His Bhumjaithai Party won 174 constituency seats with 94 percent of the vote and is expected to gain another 19 party-list seats, giving it a commanding 193 seats in the 500-member parliament.

With a conservative agenda built around national pride, security, and sovereignty now shaping Bangkok’s politics, Cambodia faces the urgent task of reinforcing its own sovereignty amid lingering border uncertainty—and a ceasefire barely a month old.

**Could Clashes Be Renewed?**  
Im Soksamphoas, associate director of the Asian Studies Centre at Michigan State University, said the risk of renewed clashes stems less from public appetite for war than from what she called a “constructed mandate.” With nearly 200 seats, she said, Anutin is now positioned to claim political legitimacy for sustaining heightened military pressure on Cambodia. His victory, she argued, was driven by a campaign that framed national security and external threats as core electoral issues—allowing hardline policies to be sold as the will of the people.

“Anutin’s victory reflects not so much an explicit popular desire for war, but the success of nationalist rhetoric in shaping electoral behavior,” Soksamphoas said. “Voting became an affirmation of identity politics and perceived national strength, rather than a clear mandate for military escalation.”

She added that portraying Cambodia as a security threat—drawing on historical grievances dating back to colonial times—has proven to be an effective political tool, enabling Thai leaders to rally support while sidelining pressing domestic socio-economic issues.

Thai scholar Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Kyoto University’s Centre for Southeast Asian Studies warned that renewed border clashes could spiral far beyond a bilateral dispute. He noted that many Thai voters appear to have embraced what he called “fear-driven pragmatism,” prioritizing a hawkish promise of security over democratic reform. During the campaign, Pavin said, Anutin portrayed structural reform as “a luxury Thailand couldn’t afford during a conflict.”

“This result doesn’t necessarily mean the majority wants war,” he said. “But it does show a willingness to trade democratic reform for a perceived sense of national security and protection of sovereign territory, as defined by the state’s narrative.”

Geopolitical analyst Seng Vanly shared that assessment, arguing that Bhumjaithai’s success gives Bangkok the political capital to keep its military on high alert along the border. He said voters were mobilized more by national sentiment and a strong defense posture than by economic or social policy platforms.

“The rise of the Bhumjaithai Party through a campaign fought on a war footing marks a significant shift in the regional security landscape,” Vanly said.

**Will The New ASEAN Chair Step In?**  
All three analysts pointed to the challenges facing the Philippines as ASEAN chair in 2026, particularly in managing a renewed Cambodia–Thailand border crisis.

Pavin warned that if ASEAN’s long-standing principle of non-interference leaves the bloc appearing powerless, fresh clashes could invite intervention from major powers such as the United States and China—turning the dispute into a broader proxy conflict.

He suggested that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. may try to move beyond the largely passive approach seen under Malaysia’s 2025 chairmanship, but cautioned that ASEAN’s structural limits remain a serious obstacle.

“ASEAN’s principle of non-interference is still a major hurdle,” he said.

Vanly said the ASEAN chair would likely move quickly and neutrally, launching shuttle diplomacy to prevent economic fallout and bring both sides to the table—possibly through the ASEAN Regional Forum or an ad hoc mechanism. Still, he warned that a Thai government emboldened by a strong domestic mandate may be difficult to influence.

“The chair’s leverage will be limited unless de-escalation is framed as essential to ASEAN’s collective economic security and its central role in Indo-Pacific stability,” he said.

Soksamphoas expressed hope that the Philippines would actively monitor the border and step in as a mediator if violence returns, following the example set by Malaysia.

“Peace and stability here should not be treated as a purely bilateral issue,” she said. “It is a regional imperative. Sustainable growth and long-term resilience depend on peace, stability, and mutual trust among ASEAN member states.”

**What Cambodia Should Do**  
Pavin urged Cambodia to immediately multilateralize the dispute to prevent Thailand from entrenching what he described as an “advance-size-level” military strategy. He said Phnom Penh should systematically document and publicize Thai activities—such as the placement of shipping containers—and raise them at the UN Security Council and within ASEAN.

He also called for the rapid deployment of ASEAN observer teams to provide an international presence on the ground, while engaging both Washington and Beijing to apply coordinated diplomatic pressure on Bangkok.

“Use the $45 million U.S. aid pledge and China’s neutrality to push Thailand back to the December 27 Joint Statement,” Pavin said. “Cambodia’s best defense is to ensure Thai military moves are seen not as sovereign reclamation, but as violations of international norms that threaten regional trade and stability.”

Echoing that view, Vanly said Cambodia must legalize and internationalize its position before Thai policies are fully implemented. He recommended depositing high-precision maritime and land maps with the United Nations and sharing them with ASEAN members to establish a solid legal foundation.

Vanly also suggested accelerating civilian development along the border by creating economic zones that serve as a “human shield” of legitimate commercial and social interests.

“Strengthening readiness isn’t just about the military,” he said. “It also means fast-tracking civilian infrastructure and economic development along the border.”

Soksamphoas stressed that the deeper challenge for Cambodia is internal. She argued the country must build greater self-reliance across political, economic, and cultural spheres, moving away from an unsustainable dependence on external actors.

“These tensions should be both a lesson and a wake-up call,” she said. “Cambodia needs to uphold its cultural values, take pride in its rich history, and also reflect honestly on darker chapters of the past.”

For long-term security, she added, Cambodia must invest in human capital and institutional strength, and nurture a new generation of leaders who are innovative and committed to the collective national interest—critical safeguards for the country’s future stability and growth.
